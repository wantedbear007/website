      <p class="paragraph">Hi there ! My name is Bhanupratap Singh. I am a student of BBA(Bachelor of Business administrator)
       . But that is just for "graduation" purpose. All of mine curiosity is in technology and computers. Everytime any new peice
       of tech arrives it makes me curious to know about it. When I was 15 I was so attracted to smartdevices that having a slight look at it and
      I can say what is the name of that device. But after that phone companies started making bezzelless phones which all look same as other.  </p>

          Followed by c++ I started to learn python. The basics were a bit on the easy side because of the previous language. When I finished basics of python I was fully into python
          untill that time I was convinced that this was the language which I wanted for my future. Because for doing small tasks I have to only write few
          line of code other then c++ in which I have to write a lot.
